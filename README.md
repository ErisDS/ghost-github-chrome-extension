Ghost GitHub Chrome Extension
=============================

Handy Chrome extension for working with the Ghost github repo

At the moment, this extension just adds a toggle button for flipping between Translation PRs and all other PRs


### Installation and Usage

To install, clone the repo and then follow the instructions for installing unpacked chrome extensions:

Once installed, when visiting https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/pulls you will see a new "Translations" button in 
the filter menu. Pressing it will toggle between Translations and other PRs. The button will remember your previous 
choice when you revisit the page.
